2. Why is building a DAG necessary in Spark but not in MapReduce?

After data cleaning, parsing and validation.
At the start of an iterative algorithm.


5.What are good cases for using a broadcast variable? Mark all that apply
Copy a large configuration dictionary to all worker nodes
Copy a large lookup table to all worker nodes
Copy a small/medium sized RDD for a join
